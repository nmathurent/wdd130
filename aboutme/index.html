      <h2>Nelson Mathurent</h2>
      <p style="width:800px">Hi everyone!. Let me introduce myself. My name is Nelson Mathurent,
          I was born in South America - Venezuela.
      </p>
      <p style="width:800px" text-align="justify">I am married to my eternal companion, Norelys, also from Venezuela, and
          we have 2 wonderful children, Natasha and Esteban. We are currently
          living in Southern California.
      </p>
      <p style="width:800px">I have been member of the church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day 
        Saints for 16 years. For me and my family, having had the opportunity
        to meet the missionaries and learn about the restored gospel has 
        been one the most beutiful gifts of our lives.
      </p>
      <p>I love to travel with my family, dance and watch movies. 
      </p>
      <p>I have registered in Pathway because I want to develop skills in web design.
